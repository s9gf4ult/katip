{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
-- | This executable is a test which runs addContext with
-- key-compatible log contexts in a tight loop. At time of writing, I
-- suspect this will result in a memory leak as we just naively
-- concatenate it into a sequence. If instead we eagerly merge the log
-- objects, each loop will overwrite the previous context and there
-- will be no memory leak. You can pass a numeric argument to this
-- executable to specify how many loops to do. -1 goes infinite.
--
-- If we didn't have to retain the log context and could eagerly merge
-- it, this wouldn't be an issue, but unfortunately we don't know
-- which keys to keep until log time, not context add time. Further,
-- we couldn't accumulate and compose key retention functions for the
-- same reason.
